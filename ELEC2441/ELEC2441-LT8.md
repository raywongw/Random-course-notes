## 8.1. Multiprocessors & Clusters

### Multiprocessors
- Computer system with at least 2 processors

- if one of the processor fails
	- other processors can still function -> inprove availability

- High performance -> high throughput for independent jobs
	- multiple processors run independent program simutaneously (Multi-threading)


##### Parallel processing program
- Single program on multiple procesors
	- SIMD (Single instruction multiple data/Vector machines)
	- Graphical Processing Unit for optimized computation

##### Cluster
- set of connected cpmputer over a LAN
- works like single large multiprocessor

- run parallel S/W on sequential or parallel H/W on multiprocessor
	- Problem: ways to make current program run more efficient


## 8.2. A New Era of Cloud & GPU Computing

##### GreptheWeb
- built by Amazon
- Search regex/terms out of a large set of documents from WWW

##### Cloud Arhitecture
- Address issues on large scale data processing
- resource intensive computation

### Modern Cloud Servers

##### Google Cloud Machine
- let people build superior machine learning model
- Cloud ML provides training + prediction services
	- identify clouds in satellite images
	- food safety
	- respond email automatically

##### Apple iCloud
- provides Core ML 2
	- allows fast performance of ML models through Create ML
		- tree ensembles
		- support vector machines
			- classifier
			- predictor

- Vision framework
- Natural Language framework
