	- Planets close to stars are hidden by flare of host stars
	- Planets far away are dim
- Small numbers of planets can be discovered by imaging
	- Nearby Stars
		- Angle between star and planet larger than farther ones
		- Light intensity
	- Large Planets
		- Reflect more light due to surface area
		- Infrared depends on temperature of planet
	- Young/Hot planets emits infrared
		- Imaging require infrared

### Examples




## Spectroscopic Binary Stars
[[PHYS1650 Chapter 13 - Double Stars, Variable Stars, Clusters and Nebulae#**Spectroscopic Binary**|link]]
#### Stellar Absorption Lines
- Discovering chemicals in absorption lines

Why does star has absorption lines
- Light from stars pass through some cold gas
	- Absorption Lines
- H2 atoms are excited in 

#### Period Wavelength Variations
- Two stars have varying wavelength from time
	- Absorption lines varies as the stars revolve around 



#### Doppler Effect
$$\lambda_{obs} = \lambda_{source} \sqrt{\frac{1+\frac{v}{c}}{1-\frac{v}{c}}}$$
For stars in our galaxy
$$\lambda_{obs} = \lambda_{source} (1+\frac{v}{c})$$


- v is the velocity of the object relative to observer
	- 
- c is speed of light

- Caused by various factors
	- Geometrical effect (Newtonian Physics)
	- Time dilation (Special Relativity)
		- Only happens when object moves at fraction of speed of light
		- Speed of light is same for all observers
		- Time may run at different rate for different observer
- Object move further away/toward Earth

#### Radial Velocity Variations
- Larger variation of radial velocity -> star further from center of mass -> star has smaller mass
- double star -> always same period


#### Kepler’s 3rd Law
- $P^2 \propto r^3$ is not exactly correct even for earth-sun
- sun is not exactly at center of mass, only within sun

##### Radius of Circular Orbit
- distance between two stars/stars-planet pair



#### Orbital Velocities
- wavelength shifts at several amstrongs
	- 10 amstrong = 1nm
- can obtain the velocity of star




#### Orbital Separation
- $v_1 = 2\pi a_1/P$
- $v_2 = 2\pi a_2/P$
- such that distance of 2 star = $a_1 + a_2$ = $P/2\pi (v_1 + v_2)$

$$a=a_{1}+a_{2}=\frac{P}{2 \pi}\frac{(v_{1r}+v_{2r})}{\sin i}$$


#### Total Mass
$m_{1}+m_{2}=\frac{P}{2 \pi G}\frac{(v_{1r}+v_{2r})^{3}}{\sin ^{3}i}$



#### Mass Ratio
- Inverse of ratio of velocity

#### Stellar Mass-Luminosity Relationship
- Total energy output of star
- Different log mass to luminosity ratio
- 

#### Orbital Inclination
- If there is inclination
	- the velocity relative to
	- Measured velocity = True velocity * sin(i)
	- Hard to determine i unless during transition




## Radial Velocity Method
### Single-line Spectroscopic Binary


### Orbital Properties
- Variation in radial velocities of stars at ~100 ms-1
- Radial Velocity Curve
	- Shape of radial velocity curve determines the eccentricity of the planet
	- non-sinusoidal -> elliptical
	- Dependent on orientation of the orbit
		- Long side towards Earth vs Short side to Earth

- Several planets orbits -> sum of sine curves

### Orbital Velocity of Host Star

Precision Radial Velocity  Measurements
- Use iodine gas to detect


- Only can see host star moving in sine/non-sine curve

### Planet Mass
- Orbital velocity -> lower limit
- 

### Orbital Separation


### Biases
- different transit methods discover different types of planets


## Transit Method
- Most common method of finding exoplanets
- Applicable to planets with orbital plane perpendicular to sky

- Theoretical
	- there is a dip when planet transit through the star
- Reality
	- Brightness gradually drop till center of sun
	- Only drop a little
	- Limb darkening


### Eclipsing Single-line Spectroscopic Binary
##### Eclipsing binary star
- Primary peak as the dimmer star pass in front of the brighter star
- Secondary peak(smaller) as the brighter star pass in front of the dimmer star

### Parameters from Light Curve
- Only 0.x% change
	- Larger planets have greater drop in relative brightness
- Period of dip is mostly same
	- Determine the dsitance of planet with the star
- Telescopes has to be placed in space for accuracy


- To get radial velocity
	- Spectrum of light
- Radial velocity + period + mass of star
	- get lower limit of mass (around 2% of difference)

### Follow-up Radial Velocity Measurements


### Radii of Exoplanet and Host Star
- Absolute size of planet and star
	- radial velocity of planet

### Transit Follow-up
- Search for transit after using radial velocity method
	- validate their findings
- Know actual mass of planet and star
	- inclination close to 90 deg
- Get size of planet and star

### First Transit Discovery
- Black hole transit in front of planet
	- Gravitational Lensing
	- Open Gravitational Lensing Experiment
- 


### Photometric Precision
- Telescopes in space have better accuracy compared to those on ground

### Scintillation
- Earth's Atmosphere has turbulent layer
	- Difference in density across different
	- Fluctuation of light


### Kepler Mission
- Kepler‘s Satellite
- Detect exoplanets of a certain patch of sky
	- Transit method
	- 
### Kepler Discoveries
- Kepler 4b
	- Tiny change in radial velocity
	- Not as eccentric orbit
	- Much smaller than jupiter in terms of mass and size
	- Much closer orbital period
- Kepler 10b
	- first rocky planet
	- much smaller changes in orbital velocity
	- 


### TESS Mission
- Look over entire sky rather than only a patch


### Biases
- bigger planet that close to transit
- one with small inclination


## Frontiers
#### Demographics of Planetary Systems across HR diagram
- Stars across main sequence
- Less planets in giants and sub-giants
- much less in white dwarfs
- higher luminosity emits light of
#### Planetary Migration
- place planet formed is different from where they are now
- Spiral Density Waves
	- planets will be pulled in by gravity
- reason that hot Jupiter exist

##### how current solar system formed
- Jupiter and Saturn first
- Uranus and Neptune then
- Jupiter is pulled to center, together with saturn
	- Some smaller objects is split to outside
- there is interaction with juputer and saturn causing them mmove outwards
	- some more objects move together, forming asteroid belt
- 

#### Habitable Planets
- Planet like Earth in terms of mass and radius
- orbit in the habitable zone
	- radiance similar to Earth

#### Exoplanet Atmospheres
- see what is in explanets of atmosphere
- relies on [[#Transit Method]] 
- find spectroscopy of planets
	- know atmospheric content available there


#### Exomoons
- unusual
