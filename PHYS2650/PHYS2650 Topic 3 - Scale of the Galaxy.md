## Astrometry
### Ancient Astrometry
- measure position of objects in sky
- to track time
- to decide when to plant and harvest
- to navigate through time
### Modern Astrometry
- 2-D position of object over the sky
- distance from us
	- parallax, 3D position
- Velocity of object
	- How each star moving 
	- [[PHYS2650 Topic 2 - Exoplanets#Radial Velocity Method|radial velocity]]
### Photometry
- Measurements of brightness of star


## Triangulation
### Trigonometric Parallax
- Trigonometrix parallax of planet
	- Half year measurement
- Creation of parsec
	- with AU

- Know position of stars -> Know angular separation
	- using degrees, right ascention

## Astrometry and Photometry through the Ages
### First Star Catalog
- Hipparchus
	- Greek Astronomer, 200 BC
	- Created the star catalogue
		- Precision of measurement: 1 degree of angular size
	- Developed modern apparent magnitude system
		- 1 to brightest, 6 to dimmest
- Statue's Celestial Sphere based on his working
	- Precision of about 1 degree
	- Double the size of moon
	

- Ptolemy
	- publish star catalogue from hipparchus' catalog

### Apparent Magnitude System
- Attempt to quantify the magnitude system
- Norman R Pogson, 1850
	- Difference in 5 magnitude -> 100 times as difference in brightness
	- Difference in magnitude -> ratio of brightness
- Base: Vega, apparent magnitude: 0
- Brightest: Sirius, apparent magnitude: -1.46
- Proxima Centauri: nearest star, apparent magnitude: 11.05
- Alpha Centauri: A: -0.01, B: 1.33
### Coordinate System
- Projection of Latitude and Longitude of Earth to the sky
- Time for Right ascension: 24h
	- Corresponds to Earth longitude on sky
- Angle for Declination
- Ecliptic at a tilted path
	- Earth rotation is 23.5 deg tilted
- Rectangular Maps are mostly distorted
	- e.g. Mercato projection


### Sextants and Octants
 - Half of mirror is coated with silver
 - measure angles in sky
 - know longitude and latitude
	 - longitude: difference of local noon and clock on ship -> get
- First large sextant
	- Ulugh Neg

		- Still have similar precision to Hipparchus
	- Star catalogue of 1018 stars

### Quadrants

## Distances
### Stellar Parallax
- trigonometric parallax
	- Only direct method for measuring distance to stars
- Stars doing circles/ellipses in sky
	- if star is aligned with orbital plane of Earth
		- linear motion
	- Perpendicular to orbital plane of Earth
		- Circular motion
- Relation between stellar parallax and distance
$$\begin{array}{r}{\tan p={\frac{1\,{\mathrm{AU}}}{d}}}\\ {\qquad\qquad d=\,{\frac{1\,{\mathrm{AU}}}{\tan p}}}\end{array}$$
- 1 pc = 206265 AU -> 3.26 ly


- Alpha Centauri stellar parallax: 754.81 masec
	- Distance: 1.32 pc


- Achieving small angular separation when smallest is 3 deg
	- Earth's refraction




### Absolute Magnitude
$$\begin{array}{c}{{m_{1}-m_{2}=\;-2.5\log_{10}{\left({\frac{f_{1}}{f_{2}}}\right)}}}\\ {{m-M=-2.5\log_{10}{\left({\frac{1/4\pi d(\mathrm{pc})^{2}}{1/4\pi[10\;\mathrm{pc}]^{2}}}\right)}}}\\ {{M=m+2.5\log_{10}{\left({\frac{[10\;\mathrm{pc}]^{2}}{[d(\mathrm{pc})]^{2}}}\right)}}}\end{array}$$


- [[#Apparent Magnitude System]] is a measure of brightness observed at the Earth
	- Cannot know actual brightness of star
- Absolute magnitude puts all stars at same distance of 10 pc


### Motion through Space
### Orbital Motion of Galaxy
- orbital speed of objects around galaxy is mostly same
- Sun at distance of 8 kpc from center
	- Stars further from galactic center seem moving away
	- Radial velocity and transverse velocity
	- Peculiar motion by nearby massive stars (gravitation)

### Proper Motion
- Star seem to have motion through space
- angular displacement of star wrt background stars
- Edmund Halley, 1718
	- Discovered the difference in stellar position by some degrees
- Compare modern measurements with 1800 years ago with Hipparchus's catalog


#### Application of proper motion of stars
- Measure distance of stars
	- Nearby stars appear to move faster than farther stars
- Discovered Stellar Parallax
	- Chose a fastest star
	- Proving earth is not at center
- Discovering astrometric binnaries
	- a wobbly trajectory of a star -> a companion revolving
	- Discover of a second White Dwarf
	- First white Dwarf by William Herschel
		- triple star system
- Galaxy Rotation
	- Assist of Photography
	- Proper motion of star is not random
		- Two stream of star moving in opposite direction


Often times
- Stellar Parallax and Proper Motion happens together
- Stelllar Parallax: Circular Motion of 1 year period
	- May be a ellipse or linear motion due to difference in declination
- Proper Motion: Mostly constant direction
### Transverse Velocity
- The velocity that we observe that it move across the sky
- Unit: asec/year
- Ratio of asec/year to km/s: 4.7 (conversion of units)
$${\frac{(\operatorname{arcsec}\operatorname{yr}^{-1})(\operatorname{pc})}{\operatorname{km}\operatorname{s}^{-1}}}={\frac{(4.84\times10^{-6}\operatorname{rad})\,(3.154\times10^{7}\operatorname{s})^{-1}(3.086\times10^{13}\operatorname{km})}{\operatorname{km}\operatorname{s}^{-1}}}=4.7$$

### Radial Velocity

- Doppler effect

### Spectral Lines
- Issac Newton, 1666
	- Sunlight is composed of spectrum of light
- Willian Hyde, 1802
	- Discovered Spectral Line in sunlight

	- Master German Optician
	- Catalogued 475 dark lines on spectrum
		- aka von Fraunhofer's Lines


- Sunlight
	- A and B: Produced by Oxygen on Earth
	- C: Ha line

#### Kirchoff's Laws of Spectroscopy
1. Hot, dense body produce a continuous spectrum
2. Hot, diffuse gas produce certain spectral lines
3. Cool, diffuse gas absorb certain spectral lines


### Doppler Effect
Relativistic Doppler Effect (Stars of nearby galaxy):
$$\lambda_{o b s}=\lambda_{s o u r c e}\sqrt{{\frac{1+v/_{C}}{1-v/_{C}}}}$$
- Taken account of several factors
	- Geometrical effects: Newtonian physics
	- Time Dilation: Special relativity


Doppler effect for stars in galaxy:
$$\lambda_{o b s}\cong\lambda_{s o u r c e}\left(1+{\frac{v}{c}}\right)$$

- How to measure the velocity of stars by difference in absorption lines


## Limitations of Ground-based Astrometry
### Refraction
- Light refracted by Earth's atmosphere before reaching ground
- Refraction(in arcmin) is inversely proportional to the elevation of star

Reasons for refraction
- Air of different density at different height -> Higher refractive index
	- Atmospheric composition
	- Density
	- Temperature
- Atmospheric Convection
	- Flow of air by temperature difference
	- Continuous mixing of air
- Mechanical Turbulence
	- Mixing of air


### Atmospheric Seeing
- Changing of refractive index
- Stars may jiggle and have refracted
- Difficult to measure angular separation between celestial object

### Telescope Gravitational Deformations
- Use mechanical suport for telescopes to measure angles

Limitations
- Telescope tube may be sagged
	- Dependent of the angle we pointed it at
-
