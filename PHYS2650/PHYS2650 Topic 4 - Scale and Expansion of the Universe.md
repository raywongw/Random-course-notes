Naming conventions
Our Galaxy: G
Other Galaxy: g

## Diffuse Objects 
### Messier Catalog
- Charles Messier, 1771
	- Original mission: Look for comets
		- Significantly larger than stars
	- Published 103+7 diffuse object
		- Contains gas cloud, star cluster, globular cluster, planetary nebulae and supernova remnant


### New General Catalog
- William Herschel
	- Catalogued ~2500 diffuse object in 3 go
- John Herschel, son of William
	- Catalogued 5079 objects
- John Dreyer
	- Combined them to NGC catalog, 7840 objects



## Nature of Spiral Nebulae 
### Galactic or Extragalactic? 
- Objects in [[#Messier Catalog]] have "Spiral Nebulae"
- Great Debate of 1920 in astronomy: Are spiral nebulae objects in our Galaxy, or entirely separate galaxies?
- Need distance to these "spiral nebulae"


### Radial Velocities
- V. M. Slipher, 1913
	- Recorded the spectrum of spiral nebula (NGC 224), spectrum absorption lines
	- Radial velocity of -300 km s^-1
	- larger than radial velocity of stars in own galaxy (~10 km s^-1)
	- 
### Spectrograph
- Use a slit to only let light from a star go through
- a diffraction grating to split spectrum of light
- join them with a camera mirror and detect by CCD

### Sunspot Spectrum
- Strong magnetic effect can split spectral lines
- Zeeman Effect


### Spectrum of Andromeda Galaxy
- same way as [[#Spectrograph]]


### Radial Velocities of Spiral Nebulae
- Need higher resolution spectral graph
- Generally higher speeds than stars at our galaxy

### Rotation
- Detected by [[#Spectrum of Andromeda Galaxy]]
- Upper part of galaxy has shift in spectral lines while lower shift to other direction

### Great Andromeda Nebula
- Brightest Nebula on sky
- Edwin Hubble
	- Take many picture of Andromeda Nebula
	- to get idea for galaxy
- How Hubble know


## Stars
### Energy Generation 
- ~250k years for gamma ray to travel from core to photosphere
	- random path
		- 
### Proton-proton chain
$$\begin{array}{c}{{{\mathrm{p+p\mathrm{\longrightarrow}}}^{2}\mathrm{H+e^{+}+v_{e}}}}\\ {{{\mathrm{p+}}^{2}\mathrm{H{\rightarrow}}^{3}\mathrm{He+\gamma}}}\\ {{{\mathrm{^3H e+}}^{3}\mathrm{He{\rightarrow}}^{4}\mathrm{He+p+p}}}\end{array}$$
- First 2 steps are done twice
- Dominates in stars of smaller than 1.5 solar mass


### Carbon-Nitrogen-Oxgen cycle
$$\begin{array}{r}{^{12}\mathrm{C}+\mathrm{p}{\to}^{13}\mathrm{N}+\gamma}\\ {\qquad^{13}\mathrm{N}{\to}^{13}\mathrm{C}+\mathrm{e}^{+}+\mathrm{v_{e}}}\\ {\qquad^{13}\mathrm{C}+\mathrm{p}{\to}^{14}\mathrm{N}+\gamma}\\ {\qquad^{14}\mathrm{N}+\mathrm{p}{\to}^{15}\mathrm{O}+\gamma}\\ {\qquad^{15}\mathrm{O}{\to}^{15}\mathrm{N}+\mathrm{e}^{+}+\mathrm{v_{e}}}\\ {\qquad^{15}\mathrm{N}+\mathrm{p}{\to}^{12}\mathrm{C}_{+}{}^{4}\mathrm{He}}\end{array}$$
- Carbon, Nitrogen, Oxygen as catalyst
- Dominates in stars of greater than 1.5 solar mass
	- Nuclear reaction is sensitive to temperature
	- higher mass -> higher core temperature


### Sources of Opacity 
- Light propagating from core to star
##### **Bound-bound transition**
- electron go from lower orbit to higher orbit
	- presence of atom/ion
	- happen in photosphere
##### **Bound-free transition**
- Electron get free from atom aka ionization
	- Shorter wavelength of light required
	- Balmer break
	- Recombination also release light energy
	- can also be by collision
##### **Free-free transition**
- Electron get attracted by charged particle and emit photon
	- Braking radiation
	- Kinetic Energy of electron
	- Can also absorb photon to gain kinetic energy in process
	- occur in deep star
##### **Electron Scattering**
- Reflection of photon and electron path
	- Dominant source of energy
	- deep in star where photon and eelctron are in high density


**Total opacity at a given wavelength**
$\kappa_{\lambda}=\kappa_{\lambda,b b}+\kappa_{\lambda,b f}+\kappa_{\lambda,f f}+\kappa_{e s}$

Mean opacity on all wavelengths
$\overline{{{\kappa}}}=\overline{{{\kappa_{b b}+\kappa_{b f}+\kappa_{f f}+\kappa_{e s}}}}$

Intensity reduction due to distance through a medium
$I(x)=I_{0}e^{-\kappa_{\nu}\rho x}$


- gamma ray produced by nuclear fusion ionize atoms and ions
- free electron collide with electron and atom, heating and ionizing gas
- electron recombine with ion, emit radiation at longer wavelength


- Transportation of energy
- For <1.5 solar mass, convection at outer
	- 0.5-1.5 has radiation at core
- For >1.5 solar mass, radiation outside and convection inside




### Energy Propagation



## Cepheid Variables
- Stars that change brightness over time regularly
- much higher brightness than Sun
- Relationship between pulsation period and Apparent magnitude

Classified as two types of cepheid variables


Why star pulsate
- Helium II ($He^{2+}$) partial ionization zone
- Changing from Helium II to Helium III, change in opacity
	- Helium III has no electron -> much less opacity
### Type I Cepheids
- brighter type of cepheid variable
- Type of cepheids that Hubble was looking for
- Metal-rich star
- Much more massive and luminous than sun

### Type II Cepheids
- dimmer type of cepheid variable
- Metal-poor stars
- in [[PHYS1650 Chapter 13 - Double Stars, Variable Stars, Clusters and Nebulae#Stellar Clusters|globular clusters]]
- 

## He II Partial ionisation Zone 
- Main cause of ionization
	- Collosion of atoms with other atoms/electron
- Only happen for helium II at a right zone
	- Enough to push some gas but not too much

- Hydrogen partial ionisation zone
	- Near the surface of star
	- a logistic function by temperature
- Helium Partial ionization zone
	- Require a higher temperature

- Mainly Bound-free

- Dominant source of opacity to UV in here
- Opacity have dependence to density and temperature
$$\bar{\kappa} \propto \frac{\rho}{T^{3.5}}$$
- Kramer's Law
	- Pressure increases
		- No. of gas particles per unit volume increases
	- Temperature increases
		- More electrons are ionized, less bound-free opacity
		- Electrons and ions have less time to get close, less free-free opacity

### κ-mechanism
- As star expands, density down, Temperature also down
	- opacity increase, brightness increase
	- Collision between helium decrease -> less ionized He III
- As star contract, density up, Temperature also up
	- opacity decrease, brightness decrease
	- Collision between helium increase -> more ionized He III
- 

### γ-mechanism
- As star contract, temperature remains
	- Energy used to convert He II to He III
	- He partial ionization zone becomes hot
