# Scale of the Solar System

##### Termination Shock
- ~100 AU
- place where solar wind and interstellar medium meet

##### Interstellar Space
- Outside Heliopause, similar to termination shock

##### Oort Cloud
- ~1,000 AU to ~100,000 AU
- Hypothesis that there is 



## Astronomical Unit
#### Definition
- Average distance of Sun and Earth
	- Orbit of Earth is in ellipse

### Utility
- Fundamental unit of distance in astronomy
- Know the actual scale of Solar System by [[PHYS1650 Chapter 4 - Brief History of Astronomy#Kepler's Third Law|Kepler's Third Law]]
- Know the distance to stars
	- Know [[PHYS2650 Topic 3 - Scale of the Galaxy|scale of our Galaxy]]



## Planetary Motion
### Tycho Brahe
- What is the correct model of the universe
- 2 competing models
	- Ptolemy's geocentric model
	- Copernicus's heliocentric model

- Observation test to distinguish the 2 model
	- full phase of venus
	- Stellar parallax
		- only able to see with telescope

- Brahe model
	- 

### Johannes Kepler
- Proved Copenicus's model and Tycho's measurements correct
	- with addition that orbits is in ellipses

#### Orbit of Planets
- Eccentricity: $e = \sqrt{1-\frac{b^2}{a^2}}$






### Laws of Planetary Motion
#### Kepler Laws
[[PHYS1650 Chapter 4 - Brief History of Astronomy#Kepler's Laws|Kepler's Laws]]
- Based on conservation of angular momentum
##### Kepler's First Law
- Orbit of planets around the Sun are ellipses with the Sun at a focus
- around a common center of mass

##### Kepler's Second Law
- line segment joining a planet and the Sun sweeps out equal areas during equal intervals of time

##### Kepler's Third Law
- $\text{period}^2 \propto \text{ average distance from sun}^3$
- The constant is same is the Sun is 






### Relative distances between Planets and the Sun
#### How to measure relative distance between Planets and Sun
- Inner planets
	- Measure the max angle that inner planets subtends
	- AU x sin(x) is the distance
- Outer planets
- 


## Mass of the Sun
- How people know mass of sun
### Newtonâ€™s law of Gravitation
$$ F = G\frac{m_1 m_2}{r^2}$$
- G is the universal gravitational constant
- r is the distance between of object

### Centripetal force
$$F = m\frac{v^2}{r}$$
- Centripetal force in planets is gravitational force


### Method to determine Solar Mass
Known: m_1 << m_2
$$G\frac{m_1 m_2}{r^2} = m_1\frac{v^2}{r}$$
$$m_2 = \frac{v^2 r}{G}$$

5 things need to
1) AU
2) Gravitational Constant
3) radius
4) m1 << m of sun
5) Circular orbit

### Universal Gravitational constant
- Measured in lab
- 


## Measure the distance between the Sun and the Earth
- Direct method: Triangulation
- 

### Trigonometric Parallax
- From 2 view point,
- compare position of object relative to background object

### Is Solar Parallax possible
- No
- Cannot observe background star in daytime
	- Scattering of sunlight on Earth
- Other solution: Measure distance between Earth and Mars

### Distance to Mars
- Done by Cassini
- One guy at Paris, one guy at French Guiana
	- Latitude is easy, longitude is unknown
	- Need to know synchronous time
- Solution: Positions of Galilean Moon in Jupiter
- Measure at the closest point between Earth and Mars
	- Largest angular displacement
	- Superior Conjunction
		- For inner planets, its inferior conjunction

- Oct 1672, Mars and Earth at opposition
	- Opportunity to measure trigonometry parallax of Mars
	- Known relative distance, Earth Mars distance, get rough AU
	- 5% smaller from today's value
#### Orbital Inclination of Planets
- All have different inclination relative to the Earth
- Around 7 degrees of difference
- All planet are built from a disc of materials

### Transit of Venus
- Venus passes through Sun and Earth, leaving a shadow
- Twice every 8 years, separate by 105 years each interval
	- Venus has inclined of orbit plane


### Measurement Geometry
- Different observer on Earth has different position of Venus relative of the Sun

- Assume Earth and Venus has same orbital plane
	- Math simpler
- One observer at Pole, one at Equator

- Kepler's 3rd law: $P^2 \propto d^3$
	- $\frac{D_{es}^3}{P_{\text{Earth}}^2} = \frac{D_{VS}^3}{P_{\text{Venus}}^(2)}$


- Real world: Inclined orbital plane
	- Results in complex trigonometry
	- 

### Timing Observations
- Measure time it takes to sun only, not the locus
- Would be different from locations
- 

### 1761 and 1769 transit of Venus
4 transit phase
- Exterior ingress (1), Venus start to enter the Sun
- Interior ingress (2), Venus enter the Sun completely
- Interior egress (3), Venus start to leave the Sun
- Exterior egress (4), Venus leaves the sun completely

1761 failed, 7 year global war
first successful observation is 1769


### Telescopic observations
- COnstellation rotate relative of orientation
- have altazimuth mount only
- 


### Determination of the Astronomical Unit 

- Determined from transit data from 1761 and 1769
- By Jerome Lalande
- Computed as 153 million kilometer

- Johann Franz Encke
- Get updated longitude to get AU
- 2.5% higher than modern value



### Modern measurements of the Astronomical Unit
- Largest angular separation between Sun, Earth and Venus is x
- Distance of sun and Earth is AU
- know AU cos(x) and x, get AU
- Send radio signal to get AU cos(x)


Why not send radio signal directly to sun
- Sun is a strong radio source
- Sun cannot reflect radio source (no solid surface)
