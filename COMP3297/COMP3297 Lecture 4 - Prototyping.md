## Basic modelling
- Understand the problem
- Give basis for the design

- Communicate the ideas about design
- 

## Unified Modelling Language
- INtegrated all different notation to one single language

- Diagram to show a static structire
- Diagram to show a dynamic behaviour



## Sequence Diagrams
- **Analysis**: Visualize how system operates in sequences
- **Design**: Ilustrate how objects interact
- bar as object, arrow as action

#### Notations
**Anonymous Instances**: ":IcyBand"
**Named Instances**: "a:IcyBand"

Messages
**Synchronoys Message**: Continuous line with filled arrow
- Sender wait for a response before continue
**Asynchronous Message**: Continuous line with open arrow
- Sender continue work after sending
**Reply Message**: Arrow with dashed line and open/closed arrow
- Optional assignment target followed by "="

**Object creation message**: Arrow with dashed line and open arrow point to a object, with new create lael



## System Sequence Diagram
- Visualize actor-system interaction
- Only interactions between systems and users
- Only for main success scenario
 - 

## Class Diagrams and Domain Model
- Conceptual class
- Associations between conceptual class
- Attributes of conceptual class

## Steps on building domain model
- See user stories
- Identify concept class
- Add attributes to them
- Add associations between class adn constraints


- building the part of interest only
