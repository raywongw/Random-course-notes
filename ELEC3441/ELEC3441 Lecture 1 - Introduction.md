## Computer Architecture
- Interface of HW/SW
- Microarchitecture + Processor + Memory + I/O
- Instruction Set Architecture

## This course focus: RISC-V ISA
- simple clean extensible
- standard ISA
- original: education+research
	- to know how processor work
- x86 and ARM too complex for teaching


## Stored Program Computer
- Program -> Sequence of instructions
1. get current instruction
2. execute instruction
3. determine next instruction to get

### Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer
- designed for ballistic calculations
- 30 ton, 72 sq km. 200KW
- Performance
	- 120 cards per minute
	- 200us addition, 6ms division
	- faster than Mark 1 1000 times
- Not reliable

### Electronic Discrete Variable Automatic Computer
- Designed the program as data
	- different from ENIAC
