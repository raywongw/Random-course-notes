### Angular Measures

Objects look bigger when they are closer to us. If the distance between an object and the observer is halved, the apparent size of the object will be doubled. The apparent size or the **angular size** of the object is the angle sustained by it.

A full circle has 360 **degrees** (°). One degree equals 60 **arc minutes** (') and one arc minute equals 60 **arc seconds** (''). The angular size of the Moon viewed from the Earth is about 0.5°.

1°= 60',    1'= 60''

Usually, if an adult has longer arms, he or she will have bigger hands. Thus, the angle sustained by, for example, the fists when we stretch out our arms is about the same for every person. Thus, we can use our hands to measure roughly the angular sizes of various objects.

At arm's length, the angular size of our fists is about 10°, fingers is about 1° and the tip of the thumb to the tip of the little finger of an extended hand is about 20°. Note that the Moon is "smaller" than the finger.
