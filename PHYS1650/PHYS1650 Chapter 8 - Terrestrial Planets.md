## Terrestrial Planets
- aka Earth Like Planets
	- Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars
- Have a solid surface


|         | Diameter to Earth | Mass ratio compared to the Earth | Density | Revolution Period | Sidereal rotation period | No. of satellites |
| ------- | ----------------- | -------------------------------- | ------- | ----------------- | ------------------------ | ----------------- |
| Mercury | 0.38              | 0.06                             | 5.4     | 88 days           | 59 days                  | 0                 |

### Mercury
- Very close to sun
	- gaseous sodium exist in atmosphere of mercury
	- Thin layer of atmosphere

- Large temperature difference between day and night
	- long sidereal rotation period and close to sun

- Full of craters
	- forms ray systems and central mountains
	- therefore geologically dead

### Venus
- Rotation is in different way
	- Anti sense from the Earth
	- almost perpendicular to orbital plane
	- Therefore no season change in Venus

- Thick Atmosphere
	- Atmospheric pressure is 90 times that of the Earth
	- $90 \text{ CO}_2, 3\% \text{ N}_2, \text{some SO}_2$
	- completely covered by clouds made of $H_2SO_4$
		- acis rain from these clouds corrode carbonate and sulphate in surface of Venus

- Full of cloud
	- Hard to observe surface of Venus directly


### Mars
- Thin layer of atmosphere
	- 1% of the Earth
	- $95\% CO_2, 3\% N_2$
	- 
- Planet-wise sandstorm
	- happens once every several years

- Red surface
	- rich in iron oxides
	- Polar ice caps in the poles of Mars
		- Carbon dioxide and Water

- Dead Volcanoes on Mars
	- Olympus Mounts (25km above surface)
	- Due to abscence of continental drift
- Canyons in Mars
	- Largest one: 5000km long, 200km wide, 7km deep

- 2 small satellites
	- not round in shape
		- not heavy enough
