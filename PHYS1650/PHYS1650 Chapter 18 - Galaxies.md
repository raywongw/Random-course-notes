### The Milky Way Galaxy

- Almost all stars visible on the Earth are in the Milky Way Galaxy
- $2\cdot 10^{11}$ stars, most on disk

##### Structure
- Galactic Disk
	- $10^5$ ly diameter
	- $10^3$ ly thickness
- Nuclear Bulge
	- $20,000$ ly radius
	- more dense inside
- Spiral Arms
	- [[PHYS1650 Chapter 4 - Brief History of Astronomy#Kepler's Laws|Kepler's Laws]] states that Spiral Arms does not exist
	- They will disappear in the future
	- [[#Density Wave Theory]] suggest the opposite
- Halo
	- Sphere-like structure
	- larger than galactic disk
	- Old stars, single or in cluster and interstellar matter

##### Classification
- 100 billion galaxies
- Areas near galactic plane have much less galaxy
	- Gas and dust blocks the view


- 3 Kinds of galaxy  Hubble's Fork Diagram
- Elliptical
	- M87
	- No spiral arm
	- Old stars
	- Smaller one may have $10^7$ stars
		- similar to large globular cluster
	- E0 to E9
- Spiral
	- Both young old stars
	- Normal Spiral
		- M31
	- Barred Spiral
		- Milky Way may be one
		- A bar near the center
		- Only 2 arms
	- SA to S_
- Irregular
	- Large Magellanic Cloud and Small Magellanic Cloud
		- Satellite galaxy
	- Most common type
	- 

##### Hubble's Fork Diagram
- Suggestion on evolution of galaxies


##### Distance to Galaxies
- Average: 20-40 galaxies
- Original: some kind of spiral nebulae
- Parallax does not work
- First Method: Cephid Variables
- Second Method: Type Ia Supernova
	- Red Giant and White Dwarf material transfer
	- Supernova once white Dwarf has 1.4 solar mass
	- All Type Ia supernova have same luminosity
		- Apparent magnitude of the supernova
- Type II Supernova are death stars


##### Density Wave Theory
- carries energy
- change in density of interstellar medium
- Stars orbit at different speed
- Density of Interstellar Medium form wave
	- Spiral Arm are high density region
	- New stars formed at wavefront
		- Higher density of 


##### Our location at Milk Way
- Orion spiral arm
- Difficult to detect spiral arms
	- Reasons
		- We are in galaxy
		- Dust Lanes made up of gas and dust
	- Ways to trace the arm
		- Use wavelength emitted by Interstellar Hydrogen (21cm)
		- Would not interact with other objects


##### Our POV
- Milky Way looks like a river of stars
- Center located at Sagittarius
	- Summer constellation
	- More beautiful in Summer (Northern Hemisphere)
- Dark site



##### Dark Matter
－ WIMP （Weak interacting massive particle)
- Objects that does not emit light
- 26.8% of universe
- revealed by gravity
	- Stars far away from galactic center move faster than expected
	- there exists more matters than we expected
- [[#Gravitational lensing effect]]
	- Guessing the 
	- Dark matter: Ordinary matter = 5

- believed to exist in anywhere
- unknown nature yet

##### Gravitational lensing effect
- Mass can bend space-time
	- can bend light
- A object behind a galaxy is observed as ring-like
	- Einstein ring
	- Reality would be some arcs around the lens



##### Dark Energy
- 68.3% of universe




##### Galaxy collision
- Stars in galaxy does not collide with each other
- Distribution of stars are distorted
- 2 stream of stars are ejected
	- form antennae-like structure
- Trigger star birth
	- Gas and Dust become dense
	- Observable by Blue Stars
- Formation of Active Galaxy
	- Radiates a large amount of energy (Infrared, ultraviolet and X-Ray)
	- aka Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN)


##### Quasar
- Quasi-stellar Object
- Small and dim in visible light
- Emit large amount of energy in Infrared and Radio
	- Large amount of red-shift in spectrum
	- Very far from us
- Maybe a supermassive black hole of center of young galaxy
	- very long distance from quasar to Earth, hence the young galaxy
