### The Moon
- Earth's Only natural satellite
- Avg. Distance: 30 times the Earth's diameter
- Mass: 1/81 of the mass of Earth
- Very thin atmospere
- Only celestial object that Human has visited to


##### Dark areas and bright areas
Dark Areas
- Mare (Maria)
- Solidified laval flows
- forms after formation of lunar crust
- Massive object hit the Moon and creates crater


Why the Earth has very little crater
- 70% of The Earth is covered in water
- atmosphere
- Plate tectronics

- Gravitation of the Moon only help a little

Moon is geologically dead
- Many craters on the surface
- No volcano activity
- which means the Moon is a complete solid

###### Craters
- Most big craters are complex
- Smaller craters are simple


##### Synodic period of the Moon
- 29.5 days
- same as rotation period

###### Synchronous rotation
- Rotation and the synodic period is same
- Center of mass of the object is nearer than the main object
	- thus the rotation is locked 

##### Formation of the Moon
**Binary accretion model**
- Moon was created at same cloud of material forming the Earth

**Giant impact model**
- Mars-sized object hit the young 
- Remaining materials formed the Moon



### Lunar Eclipse
- happens when moon behind earth
- not happen every month
	- plane of lunar orbit is not parallel to Earth's orbit


### Solar Eclipse


##### Total Solar Eclipse
- Corona of the sun becomes visible
- 


##### Annular Solar Eclipse
- when moon's angular size is smaller than the Sun
	- happens since distance between moon and sun is not constant
