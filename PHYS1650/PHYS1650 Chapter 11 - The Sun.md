### Atoms
- size of $10^{-10}$ m
- Nucleus has size of $10^{-14}$ m
- Proton and neutron has sie of size of $10^{-15}$ m
- Electron has size of $10^{-18}$ m


- Most simple atom: $^1H$ with 1 proton and 1 electron
- $^2H$ with a proton, neutron and electron
- $^3He$ for 2 proton, 1 neutron and 2 electron
- $^4He$ for 2 proton, 4 neutron and 2 electron


### Sun
- radius: 700,000km 
	- 110 times the radius of the Earth
- Mass: $2 \cdot 10^{30}$ kg


##### Outer Structure of the Sun
- A massive cloud of gas
	- mainly hydrogen (70%) and helium (30%)
- Pressure and temperature is high enough to undergo thermonuclear reaction
- Photosphere
	- around 5800K
	- Gas circulation occur
		- the gas become darker when gas become cooler
		- causing granulation

- Corona
	- $10^6$ K
	- observable during total solar eclipse
	- source of solar wind
		- causing aurora on the 


##### Sunspots and solar activities
- Corona Mass Ejection
	- Created when magnetic field destructed

- Prominences
	- Sign of active

- Sunspots
	- Dark small regions on the Sun
		- Temperature: ~4000K
		- Less lights produced
	- Appear in groups
	- Have limited life span (days to a few weeks)
	- Periodic(11 years)
		- Plot position of sunspot against time, then have butterfly diagram
	- Very few sunspots at last ice age
		- compare ratio of isotopes in old air


##### Internal structure
- Differential rotation
	- Period: around 1 month
	- equator rotates faster than poles
	- tangling the magnetic field lines

- Core
	- produce energy
- Radiative zone
	- TRansport energy by radiation
- Convective zone
	- energy transferred by convection
	

##### Energy production of the Sun
- Chemical reaction, potential energy does not last long enough

- Some sort of nuclear fusion
##### p-p chain reaction
- produces neutrinos (ch16)
	- $4 ^1H \rightarrow ^4He + \text{photons} + \text{other}$ 
	- high temperature, high density required


##### Energy transport
- Core undergoes [[#p-p chain reaction]]
- Inner layer transport by radiation
- Outer layer transport by convection

### Stability
- Gravitational attraction pulls the gas together
- The gas pressure and radiation pressure push out the
	- gas pressure -> materials in star
	- radiation pressure -> pressure due to photons

- Negative feedback mechanism
	- If the star expand -> no energy -> contract
	- If the star collapse -> more gas pressure -> expand

- If no more energy produced -> star collapse -> die
