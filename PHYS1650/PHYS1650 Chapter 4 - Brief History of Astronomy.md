### Plato
- All thing are round


### Galileo
- have better instrument
- discover that venus goes through full phases
	- Venus orbits around the Sun



### Kepler's Laws
- Kepler recorded large amount of data to generalize the three Kepler's Laws 

##### Kepler's First Law
- Orbit of planets around the Sun are ellipses with the Sun at a focus

##### Kepler's Second Law
- Area of sector of orbit from a planet to sun is always same as 

##### Kepler's Third Law
- $\text{period}^2 \propto \text{ average distance from sun}^3$
- The constant is same is the Sun is 

### Newton's Gravitation Theory

##### Newton's Law of Gravitation
$$F = \frac{G M_1M_2}{r^2}$$
- $G$: ravitational constant
- $M_1 \text{ and } M_2$: Mass of 2 bodies
- $r$ = distance between 2 body(center of mass?)


##### Four Orbit of objects from Conic Section
- Circle
- Ellipse
- Parabola (cut exactly parallel to one side of the cone)
- Hyperbola



##### Albert Einstein's General relativity
- Modifies Newton's theory and published the General Relativity
- still needs modification
	- the center of [[PHYS1650 Chapter 17 - Black Holes|black Hole]] does not apply the general relativity



### TLDR
- Someone propose a theory
- If theory applies to experiments
	- Accept the theory
- When better


### Extra
##### Falsifiability
