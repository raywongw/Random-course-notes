### Formation of a Solar System
- A educational guess
	- satisfies all known laws 
	- natural

- large cloud of gas and dust gathered around 5 billions years ago
	- Original size: ~tens of light years
- The cloud contracted due to its gravity
	- becomes higher density

- The cloud rotates
	- they believe(???)

- Conservation of Angular Momentum
	- if an object is rotating, it will continue to rotate

- Cloud of particles slowly shrink to dish shape
	- more 



### Overview of Our Solar System
- Sun
	- 100 times more massive than all other objects in solar system
- 8 Major Planets


###### Astronomical Unit (AU)
- Scale to measure the distance of objects in the Solar System
- $\text{1 AU} = 1.5x10^{11} \text{meter}$
- Ratio of diameter of Earth to AU: 1:10,000


### The Earth
- Light can travel 7.5 tuens in one second
	- Earth is not big at all

$\text{Mass of the Earth} = 6 x 10^{24} \text{kg}$
Radius = 6400km

Density = 5 x Density of water


##### Structure of the Earth
- Crust
	- 8-70km
	- not a rigid sphere, separated into plates
- Mantle
	- 2900km
	- Partially melted

- Outer Core
	- 2270km
	- believed to be in liquid form
- Inner Core
	- 1200km
	- believed to be in solid/liquid form
	- molten Iron and Nickel


##### Magnetic Field of the Earth
- Magnetic axis does not pass through Earth's Center and does not coincide with rotation axis
- 

To have magnetic field on a planet
- Core must conduct electricity
- Core must be rotating


##### Aurora
- Charge particle generate by sun goes to the Earth
- Most charged particles will hit atmosphere near 2 poles
- When hit with other particle, molecules and atoms emit light
- Can tell color of molecule hit by observe the color of aurora
	- Green light: Oxygen
	- Red Light: Nitrogen


##### Atmosphere of the Earth
| Element  | Percentage |
| -------- | ---------- |
| Nitrogen | 78%        |
| Oxygen   | 21%        |
| Argon    | ~1%        |
| CO2, other gas         |    <1%        |

Some Solar radiation reflect by atmosphere
Some absorbed by the Earth
	The Earth receives these radiation and heat up

The Earth re




##### Tides on the Earth
- 2 high tides, 2 low tides
	- Moon has stronger attractive force than the Sun
	- at New Moon and Full Moon, the tides are greater
	- at First and Third Quarter Moon, the rides are smaller
