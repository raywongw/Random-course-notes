## Jovian Planets
- aka Jupiter-like Planets
	- Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune
- Does not have a solid surface
- completely made up of gas
- high velocity of rotation flattens the Planet
- have a ring system


|         | Diameter to Earth | Mass ratio compared to the Earth | Density | Revolution Period | Sidereal rotation period | No. of discovered satellites |

### Jupiter
- largest and most massive in the Solar System
- high velocity of rotation flattens Jupiter
	- strong magnetic field

- mainly made up of hydrogen, helium
	- atmospheric pressure is 1000 times that of the Earth
	- core of jupiter is metallic hydrogen

- Great Red Spot
	- typhoon on Jupiter
	- 3 times larger than size of the Earth
	- lasted for more than 300 years

- very pale ring system


#### Satellites of Jupiter
- Four galilean satellites
	- Io, Europa, Ganymede, Callisto
- Io
	- has active volcanic activity

- Ganymede
	- largest satellite in solar system

- Europa and Callisto
	- Icy surface
	- may have water lakes under and may have life forms


### Saturn
- similar to Jupiter
- lowest density
- famous by its ring system
	- formed due to strong todal force
	- about 1km thick
	- made up of tiny dust and ice
	- Some ring system has shepherd satelites orbit outside and inside of ringlet

- Titan - Most famous sateliite
	- has a atmosphere of mostly nitrogen
	- 

### Uranus
- Rotation axis almost parallel to its orbital plane
- has a rocky core
- atmosphere less dynamic
	- not much surface feature can be seen
- light blue light by methane







### Neptune
- similar to uranus
- darker blue
- atmosphere more dynamic than uranus
- Great Dark Spot
	- lasted only for 2 years
