##### Escape velocity
$v_{esc} = \sqrt{\frac{2GM}{R}}$
- An object will fall to ground without enough velocity
- If fast enough, the object will never come back
- Earth: $12 \text{km s}^{-1}$
- Highest escape velocity suggested by Einstein: Speed of light c


### Black holes
- Theory of general relativity
	- Space-time is curved by mass
	- A massive enough balck hole
- Does not have a mass limit
	- Supermassive black hole: > $10^4$ solar masses
	- Stellar Black hole: <100 solar masses
	- Core of M87: $6.5\cdot 10^9$ solar masses


There are different types of black hole
###### Schwarzchild Black hole
- a non-rotating and electrically neutral black hole
###### Kerr Black hole
- rotating black hole
- There exist 2 horizons due to compression
	- Region between Inner and Outer Event Horizon is called Ergosphere
	- Object can escape Outer Event Horizon but will be dragged and rotate with Black Hole
	- Object cannot escape Inner Event Horizon

- may extract energy from rotating black hole
	- send an object to ergosphere
	- split the object when in ergosphere
	- the ejected part engulf by black hole
	- original part gains high speed and exit the ergosphere



###### Schwartzchild radius
$R_s = \frac{2GM}{c^2}$
- A solar mass black hole will be 3km in radius


##### Event Horizon
- Anything enters the region cannot escape


##### Singularity
- a region where all known theories break down
- planck scale
- mathematical singularity
	- something we do not know
	- Newtonian's Law of gravitation

##### Photon Sphere
- size of 1.5 schwarzchild radius
- light go in a loop due to gravity




##### POV: you free fall into black hole
- depend on distance of you and black hole
- far away: the black hole is a black circle, rear is still visible
- near: the rear universe shrinks to a round window as you go near
- inside: light from outside world pass thr
	- you does not know when you entered horizon
- feel no shock or jolt


##### POV: you are watching a guy falling into black hole
- the guy first accelerate to black hole
	- due to gravitational attraction
- eventually gets to maximum speed
- the guy decelerates its falling to the black hole
	- as the guy goes near the black hole 
- you'll never see the guy pass through event horizon



### Detection of black hole
- Objective: Find something dark with high density
- Something high density
	- Take Doppler Effect to measure orbital speed of gas
		- a object of 3 solar mass and does not emit or above is highly
	- Measure X Ray to check if it is black hole OR
		- Emits when the object interact with black hole
- Cygnus X-1
	- Cygnus: constellation
	- oldest known case of blackhole candidate



### Advanced Topics

##### No hair Theorem
- not very good name
- Can Only carry 3 properties
	- Mass
	- Angular Momentum
	- Electric Charge
- 2 Black holes have same properties behaves exactly same
- Real Black Hole has no charge as it can neutralize itself


##### Hawking Radiation
- Black Hole may emit a black body spectrum
- Hawking Temperature of blak hole $\propto$ inverse of mass
- May detect Hawking Radiation mini black hole
	- higher Hawking Temperature

##### Mini Black Hole
- Currently unable to produce


##### End of Black Hole



##### Worm Hole
- In theory, wormhole does exist
- Large drawback
	- There are black hole at 2 side
	- you cannoy get out of the black hole
