### Telescope
- Collecting light from sky
- Larger the diameter -> more light it can allow to pass
	- dimmer objects in sky can be observed
- Larger telescope -> Improve resolution

- Largest telescope in world: Keck Observatory


##### 3 Type of Optical Telescope
- Refracting telescopes
	- Only lens is used to bend light
- Reflecting telescopes
	- Only mirrors are used to bend light
- Catadioptric telescopes
	- Both lens and mirror are used to bend light
	- More compact than refracting/reflecting telescope

##### 4 Type of Observing Mechanism
- Prime Focus
- Newtonian Focus
- Schmidt-Cassegrain Focus
- Diagonal Mirror


##### Mount of Telescope
- To turn the telescope to the opposite


##### Common misconceptions
- Telescope magnification is size
	- 
- "How far can you see from the telescope"
	- More precisely, "How dim an object can you see with the telescope"

### Properties of Light
- Oscillating EM wave
- travels at $299,792,458 m s^{-1}$ in vacuum

##### Relation of wavelength and frequency:
$$c = f\lambda$$
- $f$ = Frequency of EM wave
- $\lambda$ = Wavelength of EM wave

##### Opacity of different lights
- The atmosphere does not allow most EM wave to pass through
	- only Visible Light and Microwave

- Generation of EM Wave
	- Heating an object

##### Blackbody radiation
- Happens when the object is dense and has high surface temperature
- No matter the state of the object

- Temperature is low -> peak at red region
- Temperature is high -> peak at blue region
- Color change with increasing temperature: red -> yellow -> white -> blue
- By knowing the spectrum, we can deduce the surface temperature of surface of star


##### Emission lines
- Objects may emit a higher intensity light at certain wavelength

##### Absorption lines
- Objects may absorb certain wavelength of light, causing 




### Doppler Effect
- Observed wavelength is different when it approach and leave
- e.g. when approach -> higher frequency, leaving -> lower frequency
$$\frac{\text{(Observed Wavelength - Original Wavelength)}}{\text{Original Wavelength}} = \frac v c$$
- 


##### Blue Shift
- The wavelength is shortened
- The object is approaching

##### Red Shift
- The wavelength of EM Wave is lengthened
- Object is leaving us





### Stellar Brightness

##### Apparent magnitude
- aka Visual Magnitude
- shows how bright a star is in log scale
- Dimmer star has larger magnitude number
- Each integer level represents a 2.51 times difference

- Relation between intensity and magnitude:
$$m = -\frac{5}{2}\log_{10}(\frac{I}{I_0})$$
- where $m$ = magnitude, $I$ = intensity of the star
- $I_0$ = 
- 2 in denominator = $10^2$


- Hong Kong urban: min magnitude ~0 to 1
- Hong Kong rural: min magnitude ~4
