## Cosmology
- Study whole universe

- Universe Age: 13.7 billion years

When and how the universe began? 


When and how it will end? 
- expand infinitely

What is "outside" the universe?
- Universe contains all thing


### Cosmological Principles
##### Universality
- All physical laws can be applied everywhere
	- If it can be applied near Earth -> it can be applied far away
- Properties of stars and galaxies can confirm this assumption

- What if: Speed of light has a function that grows from time
	- The stars far away will have different properties

##### Homogeneity
- assume matter is uniform everywhere
- all locations are same

- Not exactly correct at small scale
	- Most stars are at galactic disk of The Milky Way
	- Most content are at Planets and the Sun in Solar System
- Local Group
	- 1Megaparsec (1Mpc = $10^6$ pc)
	- 2 Largest galaxy: Milky Way
- Local Supercluster
	- 100 Mpc
- Larger scale shows clusters of "The Great Wall" and void
	- The largest structure is uniform


##### Isotropy
- all direction are same
- universe can be homogeneous bit not isotropic


### Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation
- TV noise in CRT "snowflake"

- Detected microwave spectrum from all over the sky
	- matched blackbody ~3K spectrum
- Observed sky microwave -> remove zodiacal light and radiation from the Milky Way
- homogemeous radiation across universe
- generated at early age of universe


### Olber's Paradox
- Eventually see a star if universe is infinite

- Light from stars take time to reach our position
- look far away -> look back in time
- assuming universe has finite age


### Cosmological Redshift and Hubble's Law
- All galaxy have redshift
	- Shifting of spectrum to red side (higher wavelength)
Ratio of redshift: $v = \text{difference in wavelength}/\text{original wavelength}$

- Assumption: Galaxies have random motion
- Observation: galaxies going away at velocities proportional to distance
$$v = H\cdot d$$
where $H$ = hubble's constant, $67km/s/Mpc$



### Big Bang Theory
- Simplest model following the cosmologial principle
- The universe keeps expanding

- When universe is young (<1ms)
	- Whole universe is hot ($10^{12} K$) 
	- Upon expansion, the universe become cooler
		- Fixed amount of energy, larger space -> lower temperature
	- [[#Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation]] at 3K

- baking of bread
	- raisins in bread are farther apart
- balloon
	- expansion
- If one galaxy emit light
	- radiation from galaxy emit light
	- it take longer for light to reach us due to expansion
	- the wavelength is lengthened due to expansion

- Rewind the universe and know the universe is 1.4b years old


### Evolution and Future of Universe
- Unknown for formation of galaxies
	- too huge and evolve too slowly


- **Radiation-dominated era**
	- first $10^6$ years
	- Energy density of photon > energy density of matter
	- First million years
		- universe full of photons
	
	
	- Formation of Protons and neutrons
		- Universe is cool enough for quarks to combine
		- Collision between nuclei is not strong
	- Formation of nucleus
		- Further cool enough for protons and neutrons to combine
	- Formation of elements
		- Further cool enough for electrons to combine to atom
	
	
	Photons energy level $\propto$ $\frac{1}{\text{radius of universe}^4}$
	- Expansion dilluted the photons density
	- Stretched out wavelength of photon
	matter energy level $\propto$ $\frac{1}{\text{radius of universe}^3}$

- **Matter-dominated era**
	- Energy density of photon < energy density of matter



- Prediction of future of universe
	- Sum of ordinary matter + dark matter + dark energy
	- mass density and dark energy density
		- dark energy density -> energy of vacuum
	- Compare the sum with critical density
	- If smaller -> Closed universe
		- Universe eventually reach maxima and contract
	- If equal -> Flat universe
	- If larger -> open universe
		- Universe expands forever


	- Current findings
		- Critical density similar to sum of dark energy and mass density
		- Type 1a supernovaes suggest universe acelerates in expanding

we dont know
