- larger stars are hotter and denser
	- burns faster and shorter life


- Star of cluster in H-R diagram
	- stars at turning point are near end of life
	- turning point at right of the chart means the cluster is older


### Death of Solar Mass Stars
- start after p-p chain reaction stops
	- No more hydrogen to undergo reaction
- helium core collapse
	- supporting forces for helium core is weaker since there is no p-p chain reaction
	- heats up the hydrogen shell around helium core
- fusion begans at hydrogen envelope around helium core
	- star become big and lower surface temperature
		- emit more energy
- becomes red giant
	- can be as large as Earth orbit
	- continue to contract and expand
		- indicates that all red giant are [[PHYS1650 Chapter 13 - Double Stars, Variable Stars, Clusters and Nebulae#Variable Star|Variable Star]]
		- until it is hot enough for helium flash
- Helium Flash
	- $3 He \rightarrow 1 C$
	- Does not produce energy in stable way
	- pulsation and generate stellar wind
		- stellar wind produced from ejection of outer shell
		- pulsating variable
	- continue until whole outer shell is ejected
- planetary nebulae

- core have no more nuclear
	- becomes less bright and hotter due to contraction
	- becomes White Dwarf



### Death of Low Mass Stars
- burn hydrogen
- become white dwarf after no hydrogen



### Nova
- a binary star system
	- one star is becoming a white dwarf
	- one star in main sequence, becoming red giant
	- very close to each other
- when one become red giant
	- main sequence star get hyrogen from red giant
	- enough matter will cause a nuclear reaction happen again on white dwarf
	-
