### Red Supergiant and Supernovae
- mass > 8 solar mass
- higher nuclear reaction rate
	- O B Atype star

- shorter lifespan
	- around 10 million years for 15 solar mass star

- high energy rate cause expand
	- gravitation can maintain if the star is with high mass

- Helium burning
	- convert helium to carbon
	- a hydrogen shell formed

- strong gravitation causes heavier element to fuse
	- He -> C -> O -> .... -> Fe
	- forming a onion like core of burning shells
		- usually 2 days to supernova when iron forms 

- Iron forming cause core to collapse dramatically due to insufficient pressure
	- iron require more energy to be fused
	- eventually whole star is collapse
	- takes 2 day

- Electrons react with protons, forming neutron and neutrinos
	- neutrinos carry energy away from the collapse of core



##### Neutrino
- Electronically neutral
- Little to no interaction with substances



##### Supernova
- Type Ia and II
- Extremely violent
- brightness can go up by 15 magnitude
- naming:
	- SN: Supernova
	- 1987: Year
	- A: No. of supernova

- frequency as observed on the Earth: estimated for once per 100 year

- Stars of mass between 0.1 to 1.4 solar massesbecomes white dwarf
	- [Chandrasekhar Limit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chandrasekhar_limit)
- Stars of mass between 1.4 to 3 solar masses becomes white dwarf
- Stars of mass above 3 solar masses becomes Black hole



##### Neutron Star
- Size of around 8 to 16km
- Generated after supernovae of star between 1.4 and 3 solar mass
- electron degenerate pressure < than gravity
- star contract to size smaller than white dwarf
	- electron and proton squezed to neutron and [[#Neutrino]]


- Structure
	- Solid Crust
	- Liquid Neutron
	- solid core(unknown)


- Magnetic Field
	- Magnetic moment of neutron
		- neutrons act as magnetic bar
	- Magnetic Field Strength of around $10^8 \to 10^{15}$ times the magnetic field of the Earth 
	- Radio waves radiate along the Magnetic Axis
	- Rotational axis does not align to magnetic axis
		- Radiation beam sweeps around
		- Lighthouse Effect

- Some rotate at a quick speed and consistent speed
	- due to high mass
	- up to more than 10 dp
	- milliseconds period
	- easy to study disturbances around the star
		- discover extrasolar planet/object


- Giant nearby
	- material exchange from Giant to neutronstar
	- upon materials arrive on surface of neutron star, X Ray emitted
	- X-ray pulsar formed




Why materials eject when core collapse
- energy from dense core transferred to less dense core
- continue to transfer and outer materials eject
