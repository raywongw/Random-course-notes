- Sun in our system is single star with constant brightness
- many stars in universe interact with other star
	- forming binary star or multiple star system
- many stars have variable brightness
	- variable stars
- clusters and nebulae
	- important objects in studying stellar evolution


### Binary Stars
- 2 stars orbit around common center of mass

- 5 type of binary stars
	- classified by how they are discovered

###### **Visual Binary**
- e.g. Mizar and Alcor
- Both componenet can be seen and nearby
	- if not near, they are only **optical doubles** 

###### **Spectroscopic Binary**
- Both star are too close together to be seen
- found out by doppler effect
	- There exist a difference in observed spectrum when the stars are orbiting from a central mass

###### **Eclipsing Binary**
- e.g. Algol
- Found out by a star passing in front of other
		- A drop in luminosity periodically

###### Contact Binary
- Material exchanges can be seen
- [[PHYS1650 Chapter 15 - Death of Less Massive Stars]]

###### **Astrometric Binary**
- e.g. Sirius
- One of the star cannot be seen for some reason
	- Detect by real motion
	- the star does not move on a line


### Variable Star
- stars that have variable brightness over time
- Light curve: the graph of variable brightness to time

- **Eclipsing Variables**

- **Pulsating Variables**
	- A star that undergoes contraction and expansion very periodically
	- its light intensity changes over time

- **Eruptive variables**
	- Sudden changes in brightness
	- includes novae and supernovae
		- Novae are binary star system that similar to [[#Contact Binary]]


### Stellar Clusters
- Group of stars that are bounded by mutual gravity
	- around tens to millions
- Stars in clusters formed around same tome
- Interstellar gas also exist

- **Open Cluster**
	- Diameter of less than 100 light years
	- Stars are relatively far apart from each other
	- Younger stars exist

- **Global Cluster**
	- More than $10^4$ stars in a region of 100 light years
	- Older stars exist



### Nebulae
- more dense region in space
	- ~$10^3$ atom per cubic cm
	- other region of space is around 1 atom per cubic cm
- around $10^2$ light years
- made up of gas and dust
-
