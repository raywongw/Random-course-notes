- [[PHYS1650 Chapter 12 - General Properties of Stars#Hertzsprung-Russel Diagram|H-R Diagram]] studies theabs magnitude against surface temperature
- it states that most stars spend about 90% of time along the main sequence

### Formation of stars
- Interstellar clouds exists
	- made up of gas and dust
	- If visible, it is called [[PHYS1650 Chapter 13 - Double Stars, Variable Stars, Clusters and Nebulae#Nebulae|Nebula]]
	- Size of up to $10^3$ light years
	- Mass of up to $10^1 \text{ to } 10^3$ solar masses
	- Mostly Hydrogen

Explained by [[PHYS1650 Chapter 18 - Galaxies#Density Wave Theory|density wave theory]]
- Density wave arrived to the interstellar clouds
	- The clouds become more dense by its own gravity
	- Protostar is formed

##### Protostar
- very dense cloud
- have accretion disk and jets
	- accretion disk of size of several pluto's orbit
	- jets eject materials from accretion disk
- exist for $10^5$ years


##### T Tauri type stars
- protostars of small size
- evolve to stars of G, K, M T type
- emit light of infrared
	- appears to be red
- More violent reaction give out shorter wavelength waves
	- gamma rays or X ray
	- Black Hole


### The H-R diagram and the Main Sequence Phase
- represented by an evolutionary track.
- Mass of a star is the most important factor determining its fate.
- When born, the cloud moves from right of the track to left (stars)
- The luminosity per surface area increases as the temperature increases

- The cloud takes about 0.1 to 100 million years to become a main sequence star
- Nuclear fusion takes place when enter main sequence
	- p-p chain reaction
- The main fusion reaction is the p-p chain, which turns four hydrogen nuclei to a helium nucleus
- The star will have a convective shell and a radiative core similar to our Sun


##### CNO cycle
- dominates if a star's mass is greater than about 1.1 solar masses
- uses carbon as a catalyst
- operates at higher temperature and density
- faster and produces more energy per second
- The core of such stars is convective
	- effectively transport heat energy out from the star
- The outer part allow efficient radiation transport to almost the stellar surface
- stars have such reaction dominated have a radiative shell and a convective core.

- The main sequence stage lasts for a long time, up to tens of billions of years for less massive stars.
- More massive stars will use up their fuel in the core in about one million years.





###### Why are jovian planets farther away from Terrestial planets
- Planet will migrate
- light and heat generated push out materials
