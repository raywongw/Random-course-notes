### Dwarf Planets
###### Eris
- discovered in 2005

###### Pluto
- 2370km diameter
- Visited by New Horizon in 2015
- not classifies to terrestrial planet or jovian planet
- icy mountains observed on surface of Pluto
- density: 2.3 times of water
- Orbital Plane is inclined 17.2%
- 5 discovered satellites
	- Charon is the largest (1200km) and only natural synchronous satellite



### Comets
- Usually named after discoverer
- Dirty snowballs
	- Ice on outer layer
	- Frozen gas and dust of around 10km diameter as core

- Coma is produced when it move closer to sun
	- Gas in the comet is vaporized
	- Radiation pressure pushes the gas away from the comet and sun
	- Results in long trail (ion trail and dust trail)


- Have a closed orbit and will visit again and again


### Asteroids
- aka minor planet
- found between the gap of [[PHYS1650 Chapter 8 - Terrestrial Planets#Mars|Mars]] and [[PHYS1650 Chapter 9 - Jovian Planets#Jupiter||Jupiter]]
- mostly not in round shape due to small gravity


### Kuiper Belt Objects
- May have original substance of when solar system form
- orbit of less than 50AU from sun
- usually very small, around 100km
	- largest one around 2336km



### Meteroids
- small particke in space that fall to earth
- most of them burn completely in atmosphere
	- due to high velocity
- If it hits the earth surface, it is a meteorite
	- may produce crater if large enough
