##### Stars
- a cloud of gas that is attracted by itself
- massive enough to undergo nuclear reaction in core


### Stellar Brightness
- Inverse Square Law
- $\text{Intensity}\times\text{Distance}^2 =Constant$
- Apparent Magnitude: $m = -\frac{5}{2}\log_10(\frac{I}{I_0})$
- Absolute Magnitude: $M = m_{apparent} -5\log_{10}(\frac{\text{distance from observer to star}}{\text{10 parsecs}})$
- Distance doubled, intensity 1/4, apparent magnitude +1.53

##### Absolute Magnitude
- Apparent magnitude at a fixed distance (32 light years, 10 parsecs)
- w

### Stellar Distance
- Distance measurement in astronomy is basic but difficult
	- Radar (radio wave) is used for nearby planet (Venus, Mars)
		- Large density needed
	- requiring knowledge of actual size and distance between objects
- Meter is not a useful unit for astronomical distances
- Astronomical Unit (A.U.) measures distances between planets in Solar System
- Light year measures distances between stars
	- 
- Parsec measures distances using parallax, the apparent motion of nearby stars but not proper motion
	- tan(1 second) = n/1AU, where n = 3.26 ly
- Proper motion is measured in angle per year
	- not the real motion of a star
	- star may move other way from horizontally
	- depends on speed, distance, and angle between real motion and line of sight


### Hertzsprung-Russel Diagram

- Crucial in discussing stellar evolution
- Plots surface temperature vs luminosity (or absolute magnitude) of stars
	- surface temperature low to high, right to left
	- absolute magnitude to luminosity (log scale)
- Spectral lines classify stars into spectral types from O to M
	- standard mnemonic for spectral types is "Oh, Be A Fine Girl, Kiss Me."
- Spectral types range from hottest (O) to coolest (M)


- Main Sequence
	- upper left to lower right
- Stars at upper right have low surface temperature but very luminous
	- giants
	- even more high then supergiant
- Stars at lower left have high surfae temperature but not luminous
	- white dwarfs
